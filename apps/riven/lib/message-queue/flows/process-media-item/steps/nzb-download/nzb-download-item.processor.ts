/**
 * Aggregates NZB download responses from all nzb-download plugin child jobs
 * and picks the first successful response via the pure `pickFirstSuccess`
 * helper. The altmount plugin should return exactly one response, but the
 * aggregation pattern supports N subscribers for future flexibility.
 *
 * On at least one success: emits `riven.media-item.nzb-download.success` with
 * `itemId` + `altmountId` and returns the aggregated output so the parent
 * validate step can persist the altmountId without re-querying children.
 *
 * On zero successes / all failures: emits `riven.media-item.nzb-download.error`
 * with reason="altmount-failed" and throws an UnrecoverableError so the parent
 * flow step is marked as ignored (continueParentOnFailure=true) rather than
 * retried.
 *
 * Uses `job.data.item` (carried through from the nzb-scrape step) for log
 * messages and event ids — avoids a DB round-trip per processed job.
